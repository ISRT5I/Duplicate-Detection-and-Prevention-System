# Duplicate-Detection-and-Prevention-System
This is a duplicate file searching program coded in python 3.6.2 designed to find duplicate files to help clean the system from clutter. It uses md5 hashing to quickly compare the files that are exact. These files include photos, videos, sound files, text-based files, and pretty much anyting. This program also allows you to whitelist files/folders as well as use a real-time scan for notifications of a new-comming duplicate file. This is a project for LSU CSC 3380 by Angel Martinez, Sean Sheehan, and Hayden Piper.
